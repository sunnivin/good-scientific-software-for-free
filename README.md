# Slides with marp 
This repo contains a NGI-template for slides written in markdown wu


### Convert to html with a template file
Pure markdown files can (currently) not split a slide in column without html. 

To convert the slidedeck into a *.html file: 

    marp --theme-set ngi-theme.css --html -w talk.md


### Some nice issues to pay attention to 

- [Import document](https://github.com/marp-team/marpit/issues/135) style.
